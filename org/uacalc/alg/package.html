<b>What is an algebra?</b> and how do we represent it in a computer?
We bascially follow <i>Algebras, Lattices, Varieties</i> by
McKenzie, McNulty, Taylor. The java interface <tt>Algebra</tt> 
describes the methods an algebra should have.
<p>
How the algebra is represented internally depends on its size and 
its origin: did the user input it? was it constructed as a direct 
product of algebra? Also there needs to be different a
representation for certain kinds of algebras such as lattices. 
<p>
For an algebra of size <tt>n</tt>, where <tt>n</tt> is 
reasonably small, we will have a map between the universe of the 
algebra and the set {0, 1, ..., n-1} and the operations will be
represented by tables on this set of integers. 
But for large algebras tables may be impractical or impossible. 
So if  <b>A</b> has 7 elements and one binary operation, we might
generate the multiplication tables for <b>A</b><sup>2</sup> but not
for <b>A</b><sup>3</sup> and certainly not for
<b>A</b><sup>4</sup>. Of course for <b>A</b><sup>3</sup> the
operations would be computed componentwise.
