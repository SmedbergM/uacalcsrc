currrent thoughts:

1. the universe of an algebra is a java.util.Set where size() can return
   a negative to indicate unknown or infinite and iterator() is optional
   but contains() is not. Algebra has the negative constantst; there may
   be more than we need. It also explain so of this stuff in more detail.

2. Elements of algebras are Objects. We may want to make a special
   Element class, but now it seems like it is not necessary.

3. In a "small" algebra the universe will be linearly ordered; that is, 
   there will be a method to obtain the kth element and a method returning
   k for that element. This has the plus that a small int based algebra
   need not store the universe in any sort of List or array.
   Internally calculations will be done with int's for speed.

4. Operation's have an optional public int intValueAt(int[] args) method
   which small algebras.
